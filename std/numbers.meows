~( ^.x.^)> ----------------------------
A yarn ball of numeric operations and
iterators. (It's mostly iterators.)

This yarn ball has very short function
names, and should most likely be taken
as a named import.

~( ^.x.^)>
An infinite iterator that yields all natural numbers.
<(^.x.^ )~

=^.x.^= natural ()
    bring cat_tree(1, 1, ( ^.x.^)> () => (paw at home.state))
meow meow


~( ^.x.^)>
An infinite iterator that yields all whole numbers.
<(^.x.^ )~

=^.x.^= whole ()
    bring cat_tree(0, 0, ( ^.x.^)> () => (paw at home.state))
meow meow


~( ^.x.^)>
An infinite iterator that yields all even whole numbers.
<(^.x.^ )~

=^.x.^= even ()
    bring cat_tree(0, 0, ( ^.x.^)> () => (home.state = home.state + 2))
meow meow


~( ^.x.^)>
Yield integer numbers starting at a and continuing until b.
The 'a' and 'b' are inclusive.
<(^.x.^ )~

=^.x.^= range(a, b)
    =^.x.^= next()
        bring home.state >= b ? nothing : paw at home.state
    meow meow
    bring cat_tree(a, a, next)
